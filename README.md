# Modal LLM Deployment with modal

This repository is a collection of projects and scripts designed for deploying and managing Large Language Models (LLMs) on the **Modal** cloud platform. It focuses on two advanced techniques: running **quantized models** (specifically using the GGUF format) and leveraging **Control Vectors (Representation Engineering)** to steer the model's output and style.
